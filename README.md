An HTML5/jQuery Snake Game

A snake game (like the old Rattler Run game) written in HTML5 and using jQuery.

This game is based on the example found at:
http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/html5-game-tutorial-make-a-snake-game-using-html5-canvas-jquery

This project was a learning tool I used to help teach my little brother about
programming in a way that would keep him interested (a game!)
